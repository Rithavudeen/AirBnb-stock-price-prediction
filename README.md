# 📈 Airbnb Stock Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project focused on forecasting **Airbnb (ABNB) stock prices** using historical market data, time‑series analysis, and predictive modeling techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end‑to‑end financial data science workflow** — from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and future price prediction.

By leveraging **time‑series features and machine learning algorithms**, the system aims to capture underlying market patterns and generate **data‑driven stock price forecasts** that can support analytical research and learning in quantitative finance.

> ⚠️ This project is intended for **educational and research purposes only** and should not be considered financial advice.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical **Airbnb stock price trends**
* Perform **data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering**
* Train predictive models for **time‑series forecasting**
* Evaluate model accuracy using **regression performance metrics**
* Build a reusable pipeline for **future price prediction**

---

## 🗂 Dataset

* Historical **Airbnb (ABNB) stock market data**
* Typical attributes include:

  * Date
  * Open, High, Low, Close prices
  * Adjusted Close
  * Trading Volume
* Data sourced from **public financial APIs or datasets** (e.g., Yahoo Finance)

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Retrieve historical stock prices
2. **Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, sort by date, normalize features
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Trend visualization, moving averages, volatility analysis
4. **Feature Engineering** – Lag features, rolling statistics, time‑based indicators
5. **Model Training** – Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM (time‑series deep learning)
6. **Evaluation** – MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score
7. **Prediction** – Forecast future stock prices

---

## 📊 Results

* Demonstrated the effectiveness of **time‑series machine learning models** for financial forecasting
* Captured **short‑term trends and seasonal behavior** in stock prices
* Provided a foundation for **advanced quantitative modeling and deep learning approaches**
